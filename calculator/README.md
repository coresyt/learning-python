# 🧮 Console Calculator – Requirements

## 🎯 Goal
Create a simple Python console app that performs basic math operations through a menu.

---

## ✅ Features

- **Menu with options**: Add, Subtract, Multiply, Divide, Exit.
- **Auto display**: Menu appears every 5 seconds.
- **Clear screen**: Clears terminal using `cls` (Windows) or `clear` (Linux/macOS).
- **User input**: Choose an operation by number (1–5).
- **Operands**: Input two integers.
- **Result display**: Show formatted result (e.g., `10 + 5 = 15`).
- **Continue**: Ask if the user wants to keep calculating (1 = yes).
- **Exit**: Ends app cleanly if "Exit" is selected.

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Runs in terminal only (no GUI)
- Clear and simple structure

## 💡 Optional Improvements

- Float support  
- Error handling (e.g., invalid input, divide by zero)  
- Operation history  
- GUI with tkinter (future)
